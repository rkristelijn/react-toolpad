# Objective

This prototype will demonstrate

- ability to get a list view
- ability to get a detail view
- ability to sort data
- ability to filter data
- ability to group data
- pagination and/or infinitive scroll
- settings are persisted in the url, so refreshing, going back, forward in the browser and sharing urls will result in the exact view with the settings

Tools used
- toolpad
- tanstack react query
- mui
- react

Main objective:

- it shouldn't matter how the data is rendered, in one or many tables (when grouped), with cards or a datagrid, the pattern should be the same, maybe even using the same state core
