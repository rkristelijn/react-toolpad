# React Toolpad Project

## What is it?
A React application that demonstrates a flexible data view system with sorting, filtering, grouping, and pagination capabilities. It supports multiple rendering options (tables, cards, etc.) and persists settings in the URL for easy sharing and navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn

## How do I start it?
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-toolpad
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to deploy
1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates a `build` directory with production-optimized files.

2. **Deploy to hosting service**
   - For GitHub Pages:
     ```bash
     npm install -g gh-pages
     gh-pages -d build
     ```
   - For Netlify/Vercel: Connect your repository and set the build command to `npm run build`
   - For traditional hosting: Upload the contents of the `build` directory to your server
